        <h2>Lisa Nicholas</h2>
        <p>Stress can impact us in many ways, emotionally, mentally and physically. High-performing individuals often find themselves having trouble sleeping, experiencing high blood pressure or becoming easily distracted. You may be feeling fatigued, depressed and not like the energetic and ambitious person you used to be. If this sounds like you, you might be overwhelmed by stressors that stem from your career or other areas of your life.</p>

        <p>Hi. I’m Allison.
            When I went to college, the career of “coach” didn’t exist. During the first 25 years of my career, I spent time in various fields that were unfolding; let’s say the professional paths were being paved as I walked upon them.</p>

        <h2>Jordan Friedman</h2>
        <p>I likely started turning into The Stress Coach when one of the world’s largest brain tumors was discovered in my head. A stress-case in college, I reluctantly enrolled in a stress management class that led to much less stress, a degree in public health, a job as Columbia University’s health education director and now a career as a global stress management speaker, trainer and author.</p>
